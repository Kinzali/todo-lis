# todo-lis
a simple to-do list program that uses HTML, CSS, and Python.
This program uses the Flask web framework to create a simple web application that displays a to-do list. The index function renders an HTML template called index.html that displays the to-do list. The add_todo function is called when a user submits a task through an HTML form, and the remove_todo function is called when a user clicks a button to remove a task from the list.
